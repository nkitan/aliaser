# aliaser

A useful tool used to create aliases for frequently used commands for your linux distribution ;)
this is a python script wrapped in a shell script which lets you add an alias to your rc file


SETUP
-----

 set the shell script as executable and run it!
 
 1.$> chmod +x src.sh                                                           
 2.$> ./src.sh
   
after initial run, script can be called by simply using aliaser as a command

examples of good aliases can be
1.  Key: ls , Value : ls --color=auto 
2.  Key: home , Value : cd $HOME
3.  Key: c , Value : clear

imagination is your friend. try making your very own aliases and share them with the community
